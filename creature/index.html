                Cbab likes to enjoy her chill time in her bedroom. The bedroom is so comfortable and warm that it seems
                 like only exist in the dream. In the spare time, Cbab always spends her time in the room. But this time, 
                 something is going wrong, and she doesn't detect it. 
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> You suddenly find yourself
                 in a warm but empty room, with only a butterfly flying around. Everything is silent.
                 As time passes, you start to feel that something is off about the room, as if a hint of unreality lurks somewhere.
                 You take a deep breath, looking around carefully, trying to find out what’s wrong. Eventually, you find the strange thing 
                 In an instant, the entire room seems to plunge into a dream, with lights and shadows becoming blurred and unclear.
                 You realize that this room is actually the dream of the butterfly. To escape, you must catch the butterfly before the
                 dream completely collapses, or you’ll be trapped inside. You act quickly, chasing after the butterfly, and finally 
                 manage to catch it just in time. Or you well be in the dream forever. After you come back, you find that the butterfly 
                 disappear. Then you realize actually the butterfly is you, you are the butterfly.
